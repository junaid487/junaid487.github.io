# Hi, I'm Junaid Alam

I am a GenAI / Machine Learning fresher with a strong focus on **clean code, reproducibility, and practical ML systems**.  
My work emphasizes **end-to-end ML pipelines**, not just model training.

---

## What I Focus On

- Machine Learning fundamentals (data → features → model → evaluation)
- Practical GenAI workflows (prompting, embeddings, retrieval)
- Writing readable, maintainable Python
- Building small but complete ML systems

---

## Skills Snapshot

**Languages**
- Python

**ML / Data**
- NumPy, Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn / plotly
- streamlit

**GenAI**
- Prompt engineering
- Embeddings & similarity search
- LLM-based classification & extraction
- RAG fundamentals (without heavy frameworks)

**Engineering**
- Git & GitHub
- Modular code structure
- Reproducible experiments
- Clear documentation

---

## Selected Projects

- **Expense Tracker with Intelligent Categorization**  
  ML-assisted expense classification with clean preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation.

- **Loan Prediction Pipeline**  
  End-to-end ML workflow including EDA, preprocessing, model comparison, and error analysis.

- **GenAI Utilities**  
  Practical experiments with prompts, embeddings, and LLM-driven tasks (summarization, classification).

---

## Currently Improving

- Model evaluation & error analysis
- Writing production-style ML code
- Understanding trade-offs in GenAI systems
